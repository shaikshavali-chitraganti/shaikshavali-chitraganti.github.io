Our resarch in Network control systems sits at the intersection of control and communication engineering. The core of this research is how to address the various control tasks when the states and/or actions trasmitted over wireless networks, which may not be perfect. The work involved theoritical understanding of the control methods in tandem with communication aspects, experimental investigation of the same with classical control setups such as rotory servo, dual rotor aero etc, and communication setups such as Software defined radios (SDRs), Long range (LoRa) modules. The simulation platforms we use are MATLAB, LabView and Python for this work.

The other research is at the intersection of optimal control and reinforcement learning, which have a lot of similar formulations. The main focuse of this research is to address the objectives of various optimal control formulations when the dynamic model is not perfectly available. The work includes theoretical investigations along with experimental validations. The simulation platforms we use are MATLAB and Python.

<!--The questions at the core of my research are also central in machine learning and AI: foundation and large-language models have recently unlocked unprecedented opportunities for providing our robots with common sense and long-term reasoning, but have also highlighted the lack of optimization methods that can reliably and automatically generate large amounts of high-quality training data.

The main outcome of my PhD has been [Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11565): a modelling and decision-making framework that efficiently combines graph search and convex optimization.
Formally, a GCS is a directed graph where the position of each vertex is a continuous variable constrained in a convex set, and the length of an edge is a convex function of the position of its endpoints.
Almost any problem in graph theory can be extended to GCS in a natural way, yielding a new class of problems with a wide range of applications.
My main contribution has been a general methodology to reformulate any GCS problem as a compact mixed-integer program with very tight convex relaxation.

The shortest-path problem in GCS is especially important in robotics, since it encompasses as special cases many trajectory-optimization and motion-planning problems.
Through a single convex program, we can now design [globally optimal trajectories for a car traversing a maze in minimum time, or solve intricate bi-manual manipulation problems](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adf7843).

[Our laboratory](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) is mainly focused on robotics.
We use cutting-edge numerical optimization to solve manipulation and locomotion problems.
Never before has robotics posed such challenging and stimulating issues: our ambitious goal is to solve them using rigorous mathematics. -->
