I am a PhD student at the [Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu) at MIT, working under the supervision of [Russ Tedrake](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) and [Pablo Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/).
Since November 2022 I am visiting [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/)'s group at Stanford University.
